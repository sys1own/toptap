This game was developed through a highly iterative and collaborative process. It started with a basic box-tapping mechanic and, through continuous feedback and refinement, grew to include advanced features like dual layouts, a streak system, and a complete visual overhaul. Each feature was carefully considered to enhance the player experience, from the fairness of the play area to the aesthetic of the decorations.

â€‹Project created in 2025.
